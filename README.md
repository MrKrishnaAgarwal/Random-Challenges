## Random Challenges

This is a collection of random challenges I've found on the internet. You can make a pull request to add more challenges and also to add your solutions to the challenges.

Contribute to this repository by adding your solutions to the challenges and also by adding more challenges.

When you complete a challenge you can add your solution to the challenge by creating a folder with your name and adding your solution to the folder and then make a pull request.

After you make a pull request, I will review your solution and if it's correct I will merge it.

Make sure to make a folder for each challenge you solve and inside the folder add your solution with your folder.
